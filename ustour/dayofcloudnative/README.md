# Day of Cloud Native Workshop, Oslo

This workshop was conducted at the [Day of Cloud Native](https://www.code-conf.com/2018/dcn/) in Oslo, March 2018. The goals of this workshop were to:

* Introduce [Chaos Engineering](http://principlesofchaos.org/)
* Introduce why Chaos Engineering is important to Cloud Native systems
* Introduce the free and open source [Chaos Toolkit](http://chaostoolkit.org/)
* Discuss production failure experiences and how to construct Game Days
* Show how to build automated Chaos Experiments with the Chaos Toolkit

Conversations and outcomes from this workshop are documented in the ["Geek on a Harley, Road to GOTO Chicago: Chaos Tour"](https://leanpub.com/geekonaharleychaostour) book. The book is free but if you give a donation all proceeds will go to [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/).
